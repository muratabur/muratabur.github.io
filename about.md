*If you have an apple and I have an apple and we exchange these apples then you and I will still each have one apple. But if you have an idea and I have an idea and we exchange these ideas, then each of us will have two ideas.*  - George Bernard Shaw

I have always been interested in how the world works. That simple phrase means a lot of different things to a lot of different people. Even for myself, the answer to that question has changed over time and no doubt will continue to change. Over the years, I have noticed some recurring themes and so now I am taking the next step in this lifelong research project and recording these observations before I get senile and forget.

### A bit of background
I am Turkish, grew up in the US and Italy and now live in London. 
I studied Physics and Math at the [University of Chicago][uofc].
I spent nearly a decade in investment banking (before and after the crisis).
In 2014, I co-founded [Suade][suade] with my partner Diana to make the financial system better for everyone.

I am a big fan of doing things I don't know how to do. Some people call it learning.
