<aside>
<num>1.</num> Cloud in this context refers to plain and simple public cloud and not the numerous and inefficient variations and compromises that exist in-between on-premise and public cloud.

As a FinTech company you are well advised to avoid metioning *banking* and the *cloud*<sup>1</sup> in the same sentence. Cloud providers advise you to instead refer to specific cloud services like "elastic compute resources," "encrypted, redundant storage," "continuous delivery" and "virtualisation." No matter how you frame it though, the fact remains that banks are not using the cloud and the reason is not a technological one.

Banks are robbed much more frequently
