title: "Good problems to have, and how to solve them"

---

Sometimes in startupland you will be faced with what people call *good problems to have*. Good problems to have relate to growth and scaling. Too many inbound requests, too much data, too may users and so on. If your greatest worries are how you could be growing faster, those are good problems to have. 

These kind of problems will have you feeling like you're drowning, literally swamped and feeling like there are not enough hours in a day. One of the VC's we like refers to this as "the breaking point," and he says that this is the point where you should consider fundraising, not before and not after. So fundraising is indeed one way to deal with this issue, but money doesn't always solve the problem - and money isn't always available. 

In general, there are four approaches you can take and which approach is easiest will depend on the company's situation and the problem at hand.

# [Brute Force](#brute-force)
We all know the brute force method. Keep doing more of the same. Increase ad spend to increase traffic. Hire more sales people to tackle more leads. Add more RAM/CPU to process more data. Brute force is the most obvious answer and also the most costly. It's returns are generally linear or worse as there tend to be limits to this kind of growth as it has diminishing returns.

# [Change the product](#change-the-product)
Design and user-experience can have a phenomenal impact on how users interact with your product and how they value it. Or it might not. If you are not solving a real problem for the user, it doesn't really matter how beautiful or user-friendly it is. Then again, if users are not keen to purchase things in their shopping basket because the checkout process is really confusing (or requires visiting another site), then spending a week thinking about how this could be designed better could yield unexpected, positive and lasting outcomes. Revamping your product through design or a much-requested feature can change the slope of your growth by 10%, 20% or maybe more. But the order of magnitude is in the 1-2x range. 

Unlike the brute force method, product change is of course more sustainable and doesn't require continued investment every month. But even the iPhone starts to look old after a few years and if you are successful, soon your competitors will employ a similar shopping-basket checkout process.

# Leverage users
Another way to jump start growth is through your users. Imagine if Tripadvisor had tried to brute force all their restaurant reviews. Instead, they leveraged the power of the crowd to generate that content for them. Successful marketplace companies have employed this to devastating effect. Think of Ebay, Amazon or more recently, AirBnB. They all started as small, fledgling platforms but thanks to the ingenuity of their founders, they found a way to persuade buyers and sellers that there was no better place to go to market. Good open source projects are also able to leverage users to great effect. 

Social and communication platforms have an even greater network effect. You can't Skype or Whatsapp alone. These products naturally encourage viral adoption and hence didn't require a ton of features or sales teams to build out. Dropbox is another that leveraged its users to "sell" its product for them as you automatically had to sign up if a Dropbox user shared something with you. 

As expected, network effects can have a dramatic, exponential impact on growth. While some products and business models naturally lend themselves to network effects (marketplaces, social networks, messaging, etc.) users can be leveraged in any business. Forums and message boards can be set up for users to support each other. Certifications and partnerships worked wonders for the large enterprise vendors to distribute and establish themselves within organisations.
