Convertible notes seem to be all the rage these days amongst startup founders and (strangely) investors and it has really been bothering me because it means the "entrepreneurial" community is no better than pre-crisis bankers, and actually much worse. At least bankers tried to price the risk.ompany

### Bonds
Bonds are the fundamental building block of our society. Governments implement monetary policy through regular issuances of bonds, companies finance their everyday operations through bonds and the general public gobbles these up in their pensions and savings. 

Bonds work very simply: An investor gives a company 100 dollars today to get (100 + X) back at a set time in the future, The size of X depends on the probability of default of the company. In other words, will the copmany still be operational, and if so will they have the funds to pay back (100 + X)? 

> *BOND MECHANICS*
> t0: Investor ---$100--->  Company 
> t1: Investor <--$110----  Company 

Now, if the "Company" is two people and a 10-slide deck, the chance of default is immense (95% of startups fail, right?) so that amount for X is ridiculously high. In real terms, it is most likely in the 20-30%
