When you start a new company, the company is basically worthless, just a name. If you start with some funding, then it is worth exactly the cash in that bank account. Then you make a presentation, you design a logo, you build a webpage, a prototype and so on. The more things you make 'as a company,' the more value you create. What creates these things (particularly for a software company), are the people. So until the company has inertia from its reputation, its brand or its relationships, it is the people that make the company worth something. The people are the ones that represent the company's image, build its product and develop the customer and community relationships.

As a tech startup, you will probably go on to spend 90% of your money on people and while that number might go down a bit, it will almost always remain your primary spend. Hence, there is no greater task you will do as a manager than hiring and recruiting the best people to join your team. And this is what 

But every manager you talk to says it is one of the hardest, unscalable and most time consuming things they do. There is no science and sometimes you get lucky and you have to trust your intuition. While that may be true if you are a seasoned manager and have that intuition, most startup founders never had to hire a workforce from scratch with below-market resources.<sup>1</sup><aside><num>1.</num>I was part of the interviewing and hiring process for recent graduates when I worked at BNP Paribas, but hiring 2 new staff into 100,000 employees is a lot less risky when compared to 2 new people who will represent half the workforce (which is probably why they let me do that anyways).</aside>
