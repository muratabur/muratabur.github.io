Efficient Market Hypothesis: Markets tend to an equilibrium. All information is immediately and perfectly represented. 

- Markets in fact are inherently inefficient. That is why man goes to market.

Game theory/prospect theory contradicts the economics assumptions that man is always rational and follows predictions of utility.

Game theory/prospect theory give unexpected but 'true' results because they present unexpected and inhuman situations. Money is used as an objective quantity for relative comparison when in fact money is highly personal and non-universal. Ask a starving man if he prefers a $1000 or an apple. if there is no *efficient market* money has no value.
