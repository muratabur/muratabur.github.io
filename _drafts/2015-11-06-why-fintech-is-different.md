Enterprise FinTech is a unique sector. By *enterprise FinTech* I mean software built and designed for banks, fund managers and other financial institutions. So if you are considering an enterprise FinTech business, here are a few key differentiators:

# Smart customers
Nearly everyone you meet at a financial firm will have a college degree and  likely more experience than you doing what they do. Whether a buyer, a user or someone along the chain, you will be continuously faced with clever and capable people. As such, they will not accept a mediocre product, missing features or poor support. The upside is that they often know what they want and will tell you. You will not have to waste time A/B testing the color of your buttons or new ideas.

# Rich customers
Let's face it, financial institutions have all our money. They know how money works and how profit is made. They have budget for products that solve their problems and they even have budget for ones that create more problems.
