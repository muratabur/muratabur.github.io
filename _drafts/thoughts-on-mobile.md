# Mobile is eating the world
There is a pervasive theme, due somewhat in part to [Andreesen Horowitz's][a16z] bold [statements regarding the future of mobile][mobile-eating], that since the invention of the iphone, mobile is eating the world and hence everything should take a mobile-first approach. I have often heard that the invention of the smartphone is the single greatest technological leap forward.

Personally, I find this hard to accept. In fact, I find the move from landline to mobile that happened at the turn of the millenium to be infinitely more impactful than the move from mobile phone to smartphone.

# My mobile usage
I have a smartphone and I do get use out of it. My top 5 use cases are as follows:

1. Calls
2. Email (Outlook/Gmail)
3. Google Maps
4. Chat (Whatsapp)
5. Random internet searches (Chrome)
