The modern "startup accelerator" model was popularized by Y-Combinator in 2005 as a means of taking a small group of inexperienced but talented individuals and giving them 3 months of freedom to grow ideas into businesses. It was heavily focused on software businesses and billion-dollar opportunities. The success has been unfathomable with a number of the incubated startups growing into billion-dollar *unicorn* companies in a few short years. Since then the number of accelerators around the world has been growing almost as fast as the number of startups. 

### The YC dilemma
The essential recipe is still bringing young tech companies together with a curated group of mentors but few programs outside the valley are able to hold a candle to the ridiculous success of Y-Combinator. Whether you rank it by valuation, funding, jobs created or just revolutionary tech, Y Combinator cohorts simply stand out from the crowd.

So what are they doing differently? There are a few theories:

- **YC gets first pick**
	Maybe, but the team that gets first pick in the NFL draft rarely wins the SuperBowl. Plus, given the super early stage of the startups, often the company coming out resembles nothing like the one that went in. It is unlikely that they *know* how to pick winners through some secret magic as they too, pick a bunch of failures and also fail to pick a bunch of winners.

- **PG is a genius**
	Yes, Paul Graham is brilliant, I treasure some of his blog posts like gold dust. But there are loads of brilliant people and posts out there, and this brilliance is now easily accessible to everyone (interweb!). So I am doubtful that YC has a *higher level of understanding* than everyone else and have not shared it already. 

- **Access to capital**
	People often make the mistake that funding=success and cite that YC companies on average get a lot more funding on Demo Day. Then why do so many still fail, and why don't VCs just throw money at any startup to make it succeed? Also, VCs try desperately to make themselves accessible and scout the market, you will see reps at all the Demo Days of all the accelerators. So I would not cite access to capital as key differentiator.

- **Network**
	When talking about scaling, you always look for network effects and I think this is the key differentiator and the *hidden value* in the YC brand. In fact it is so hidden, that even some YC alumni fail to discover it in their time there.  


### Founder secrets 
The hidden value YC actually delivers is its close proximity and access to founders running $5mn, $50mn, $50bn and $500bn businesses. Successful founders from decades of Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and *successful founders who are now alumni*.Who could you go to for advice running a $1bn software company in Kansas? No-one, so $1bn software companies don't often come from Kansas.  And successful founders breed more successful founders because the best advice any founder ever gets is from another founder. I'm not talking about advice from Marc Andreesen and his days at Netscape. That's lore from 20 years ago and most of that is already published in his blogs and memoirs. I'm talking about the humiliating and awful truth that startup founders only share with each other, and only in person, never in writing. No one blogs *this* stuff.

> Like the guy who maxxed out his credit card to bridge 3 weeks of bankruptcy to pay his employees before landing a major contract. Or the founder who cleverly navigated the fact that she was 6 months pregnant during her Series A. The founder that failed to raise a Series A for 3 years and then got a $20mn check. Or the CTO that persuaded a cloud provider into offering $800k of free cloud credit. The story of the team that negotiated a $100mn contract before even incorporating the copmany. The guy that spent 18 hours a day for a month on the subway, manually signing up commuters to demonstrate growth and get feedback on his app. The dude that cleaned toilets saturday mornings to design a "find-a-cleaner" website. The founder that explained that enterprise sales is measured in liters of alcohol, not in phone calls or meetings. How to avoid liability in your SLAs, how to keep tabs your competition, how to qualify for tax breaks, how to pitch your unauthorised personal data mining software as a waste collection service and get the city council to fund it... 

This kind of advice is detailed, highly relevant and priceless. That is because these founders are the ones who are 3 months, 6 months and a year ahead of you. The details you want to know and truth are still fresh in their minds - and they need someone to talk to, too. If you spent 3 sleepless weeks worrying about your employee option scheme you want to tell someone.

As a founder, you can't tell your friends, family or colleagues the above things no more than you can tell your customers or your investors. You are like Midas and other founders are your cathartic outlet. 


### How acceleration happens
Guy Kawasaki has a great set of [slides][1] which tell the story of the ice-making industry. It starts with people cutting ice blocks out of frozen lakes, then moves to central ice-factories that deliver ice to eventually the home fridge-freezer. He sees each of these as "jumps" in the curve and aptly points out that ice cutters didn't event the ice factory and the ice factory didn't become fridge copmanies. This comes back to the idea that even though they had all the customers, they didn't see the next jump in the curve because customers know what they want (ice) but don't know what they need. And this is the job of the entrepreneur.

So the entrepreneur has two objectives:

1. Come up with a plan
2. Execute on the plan

The first objective is typically called "the problem statement" and usually comes from a problem the founders have identified or experienced themselves. While they will have a vague idea like "catching a cab is a bitch," the actual pain point will not be clear until more work has been done. This is usually quite straightforward and is about asking the right questions to the right people. The guys at FounderCentric have some good [flashcards][2] on CustDev. The easiest part as most customers know what they want Books like the Lean Startup suggest that frequent discussions with customers and iterating on quick, cheap stabs at a product will help you achieve the second objective.

Once you have decided to take a stab how do you execute? Where to stab? How hard to stab? Who to stab? And who to stab first? Answers to these questions are very easy for people who just went through that process. It's like asking a guy coming down the mountain how to get up.

Acceleration then, is directly correlated to the number and frequency of interactions you have with relevant founders who have just been through the same execution shitstorm you see coming. Acceleration happens when you can get through that shitstorm exponentially faster than you would have without that founder's advice. And the shitstorms just keep coming faster and getting bigger so you need access to that advice like an addict needs his crack.

So while accelerators can help you get through the first few hurdles, founders need to learn how to accelerate themselves by finding founders working in similar industries with similar problems.
