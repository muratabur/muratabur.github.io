### From Wikipedia:
> In business, [outsourcing][outsource-wiki] involves the contracting out of a business process to another party (compare business process outsourcing). The concept "outsourcing" came from American Glossary 'outside resourcing' and it dates back to at least 1981. Outsourcing can also be viewed as any assistance from an intermediary that is more capable of or familiar with certain practices than us. It is just a way of seeking for assistance.
Outsourcing is a very important tool for reducing cost and improving quality.[citation needed] If an organization does one or all its work by itself, its work may affect its production quality. So, an organization must recognize some important areas where it can reduce its costs and maintain high quality in its products and/or services.

### From the Oxford English Dictionary:
> 1. Obtain (goods or a service) by contract from an outside supplier.
> 2. Contract (work) out.

Reasons given for outsourcing are typically:
- to reduce costs
- lack of in-house expertise
- flexible or elastic control of supply/demand
