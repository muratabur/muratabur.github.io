# From the design of everyday things:
- AFFORDANCE: What does this let me do? (kettle button lets you boil water)
- SIGNIFIER: How do I know that is what it lets me do? (steam icon on the button)
- MAPPING: There should be a clear relationship between a control and its result. Related controls should be grouped.  (on/off button should be somewhere else)
- FEEDBACK: Should be immediate, informative but not excessive. (click or light on)
- CONCEPTUAL MODELS: conceptual model is an explanation, usually highly simplified, of how something works. It doesnâ€™t have to be complete or even accurate as long as it is useful. 

# DO NOT BLAME USERS FOR ERRORS
- Do not show technical error messages that an everyday user can not fix.
- Do not impede a work in progress (HALT), always offer a solution to continue (Y/N)?
