# From the design of everyday things:
- AFFORDANCE: What does this let me do?
- SIGNIFIER: How do I know that is what it lets me do?
- MAPPING: There should be a clear relationship between a control and its result. Related controls should be grouped.
- FEEDBACK: Should be immediate, informative but not excessive.

- CONCEPTUAL MODELS: conceptual model is an explanation, usually highly simplified, of how something works. It doesnâ€™t have to be complete or even accurate as long as it is useful
