### What's in your GUT
A [GUT][GUT] is a Grand Unified Theory that attempts to tie existing theories from different disciplines together. This is often necessary as two 'correct' theories can appear in conflict under certain circumstances. A typical example is [the conflict between Relativity and Quantum Mechanics][relvqm] that have caused headaches to physicists for nearly 100 years. 

The objective of a personal GUT is that of typing together all the years of study and life experiences into a single volume of universal truths or theories that are not limited to specific domains. 

### The problem with modern education
This kind of broad-brush work was typical of the polymath thinkers we study in history, yet is not readily encouraged nowadays. Think of the ancient Greeks: Aristotle, Plato, Archimedes, Pythagoras... all great *thinkers*, it didn't matter whether they applied themselves to philosophy, ethics, math, science, law or politics. The rennaissance brought back aspirations of Greek thought. Leonardo would spend one day painting, the next on farmland irrigation, the next building engineering marvels, and the next dissecting a dead body (among many other things). This continued throughout history and for many famous 'mathematicians,' math was just their hobby. Or Gregor Mendel, the lonely monk who fathered genetics while tending to his plants. History is littered with contributions from *hobbyists*. A pharmcist categorising all the [clouds][clouds]. Darwin...

and my favorite hobbyist of all time: Einstein, a 3rd-tier patent office worker who after publishing quite possibly the 3 greatest scientific achievements of the century in the same year (1905), was denied an academic position and after returning to the patent office was also denied promotion.  

These inspirational people form the bedrock of humanity, our knowledge-base and our greatest accomplishments - yet we are not taught to follow in their footsteps. We are told to assume people like that who can make significant individual contributions to many different fields simply cannot exist today. We are taught to seek complexity. We are taught to yearn for difficult answers. The more you work or study, the more you are forced to specialize until eventually you become the only person that understands 'your field.' Look at the history of Nobel Prizes in Physics. 10 medals for work measuring properties of neutrinos! Einstein didn't even get a Nobel Prize for Relativity! 

> **GUT 1**: The world is not complex.

Complexity is a lack of understanding.

> **GUT 2**:
